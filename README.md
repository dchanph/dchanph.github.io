The Onboarding

The Onboarding is a gamification created to disseminate information about Maple to its staff in a fun way.

It is intentionally kept simple:
a. One player at a time;
b. Drag and drop the pictures into the correct boxes within a short time frame; and
c. Motivate the player to win more by rewarding with $10 for every second left in the game.

Technologies adopted:
Use of bootstrap, css, javascript, jquery and html.
